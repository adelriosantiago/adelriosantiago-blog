# Galaxy generator in THREE.js

I've been experimenting with THREE.js. I am quite new to it and I am really impressed about its performance.

The Lorenz attractor is a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions.

I've been recently thinking a lot about the "butterfly effect". Where even a minuscule disturbance of an initial parameter (in real-life it could be the air due to a butterfly flapping its wings), our ability to predict the future course will always fail.
