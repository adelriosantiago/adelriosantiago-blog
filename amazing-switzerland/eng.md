# Three things you notice when you first arrive in Switzerland

It has been around 10 days since I moved Switzerland as a Agile consultant and Node.JS developer. After arriving I was curious about the first "only in Switzerland" things that I would discover. Here are a few things, if you have been there, this will surely serve as a reminder:

### 1.- Trains departing on second precision

Seriously, never underestimate Swiss punctuality! Especially at the metro station. Other services, like shops may open a bit late (meaning 2 or 3 minutes late) but trains seem to always, **always** depart at the right second and arrive at the right minute or earlier. Trains are so precise that you see people using them as clocks:

 - *What time is it?*
 - *Hm, I don't know, I don't have a watch... Ohh wait, **that** train is passing by, it is 15:33...*

Picture of me *-coming from a Latin Am√©rican country-* during my first days in CH:

### 2.- Really really good chocolate

Swiss chocolate is very good. Even chocolate bars like Toblerone that you can find almost anywhere seem to taste different. The best chocolate is *-of course-* local traditional chocolate.

By the way did you know that there is a bear in its logo? It has always been right there.

### 3. Church bells sounds all the time

This one is quite strange given that Swiss culture praises and adores low-noise environments. Speaking loudly is quite disapproved here, doing noise on Sundays may result in a visit from the police. Everyone is expected be tranquil, except for the church bells. They will sound everywhere, **at any time** for completely unexpected reasons.

Fun thing is that you will start to like them after a while.
