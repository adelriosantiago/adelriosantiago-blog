# Three things you notice when you first arrive in Switzerland

It has been around 10 days since I moved to Switzerland as a tech consultant. Here are a few things that you notice after arriving this amazing country.

### 1.- Trains departing on second precision

Seriously, don't subestimate Swiss punctuality, especially at the metro station. Trains depart at the right second and arrive at the right minute or earlier.

### 2.- Really really good chocolate

Swiss chocolate is very good. Even chocolate bars like Toblerone that you can find almost anywhere seem to taste different.

By the way did you know that there is a bear in its logo? It has always been right there.

### 3. Church bells sounds all the time

This one is quite strange given that Swiss culture praises and adores low noise environments. Speaking loudly is quite disapproved here. But the expection are church bells. They will sound everywhere, **at any time** for completely unexpected reasons.

Fun thing is that you will start to like them after a while.
