# Comparing Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure

This is a quick review about the capabilities of both AWS Services and Microsoft Azure.

#### Easiness to get started

Microsoft Azure is extremely easy to use. You can literally set up an A.I. workspace in minutes.

**Winner:** Microsoft Azure hands down.

#### Professional feeling

For some reason, I think Amazon's services look more professional. Whenever I use Azure I feel like using some kind of "beginner interface". Don't get me wrong, Azure services can be used in end-user, professional settings, but the interface looks more like a student interface rather than a developer interface.

**Winner:** Amazon AWS

#### Pricing

Microsoft's Azure has a very kind free trial in which you get free 200 USD to use.

By the way a great course to learn how to use Azure and get some knowledge in A.I. is this edX course: [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (DAT 263x) edX Course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-ai-2) by Microsoft.
