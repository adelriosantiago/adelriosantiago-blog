After several years using Linux I've come up with what I would call the "linux machine minimum standards". These are 5 points that I see myself doing on every new linux machine, wheteher it is a testing virtual machine, a server at Amazon or Digital Ocean, or your default operating system, these 5 points may make your life easier:

1.- Replace **rm** with **trash-put**: For sure you have seen the jokes about people mistakenly doing a **rm -rf .**... While you might not end up executing that exact command, removing the wrong file(s) for whatever reason is a pain. With this replacement you can easily recover them with the command **recover-trash**.

See: https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli and http://www.webupd8.org/2010/02/make-rm-move-files-to-trash-instead-of.html


2.- 
3.- 
4.- 
5.- Use the Superflat UI: If you are using an UI, I highly recommend the Superflat theme. Who says that a clean desktop can't improve your productivity?
