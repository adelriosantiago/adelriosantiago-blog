exmaples:
-good: everytime you create a new image asset you have to classify with at least 2 tags
-bad: before you upload an image, ask the image classifier for the right tags
-even worse: send the image to the master clasifier (here the throughput is severely constrained), imagine if you coulnd't classify flicker's image, and an institutionalized body would need to so
