# A first model in Blender

I started modelling in Blender as a hobby. My inspiration are all the scenes found in my [Low poly art](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/adelriosantiago/low-poly-art/) Pinterest folder.

Blender is an amazing application, quite honestly I don't often see such high-quality in Open Source software. The only drawback of it is the very steep learning curve. Using Blender is like coding, you will be asking Google *-a lot-* of questions.
