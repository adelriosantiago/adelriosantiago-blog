# A first model in Blender

I started modelling in Blender as a hobby. My inspiration were all the scenes found in my [Low poly art](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/adelriosantiago/low-poly-art/) Pinterest folder.

In case you want to modify the model, here is the [downloadable .blend file](/articles/a-first-model-in-blender/files/cone-island.blend).

Blender is an amazing application, quite honestly I don't often see such high-quality in Open Source software. The only drawback of Blender is the extremely steep learning curve. Using Blender is like coding: You will be asking Google *-a lot-* of questions.
