# Important dates in Bitcoin history

These are the most important dates in the history of bitcoin and blockchain:

###### 1.- October 31st, 2008: Bitcoin whitepaper

This was the day Satoshi Nakamoto published a scientific paper that started the whole bitcoin movement. See [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

###### 2.- January 3rd, 2009: The Genesis block

The genesis block was [the first published block in the blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block). The block contained the text *"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."*

The hash of the block is "000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f". For some unknown reason, it contained more leading zeros than required for that date. If you are lucky the block can be seen [here](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f). But you will probably get a "please try again shortly" message for blocks that old.

###### 3. May 22nd, 2010: The pizza day

The first bitcoin purchase. A man named Laszlo Hanyecz purchased 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. The bitcoin value was approximately $0.08 USD at the time of the offer. [Laszlo's presumed twitter account](https://twitter.com/hanyeczlaszlo?lang=en) (not verified) reads: *"I am the person who bought the 10000btc pizza 8 years ago. I am poor now"*.

###### 4. November 28th, 2013: 1 Bitcoin = 1,000USD

The day one bitcoin was worth 1,000USD. A few days later, the price dropped below this mark for almost 5 years.

###### 5. March 2nd, 2017: 1 Bitcoin = 1 Oz of Gold

That day one bitcoin was worth more than 1 ounce of gold.

I will keep adding more dates as time goes by. Until next block!
