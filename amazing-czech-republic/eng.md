# Five things you notice when you first arrive in Czech Republic

Czech Republic is one of the most underrated destinations in the world. It has beautiful landscapes, great job opportunities, amazing entertainment 

### 1.- Cobblestones

The first thing you notice is that all streets are made of cobblestones. It looks simply beautiful. I have to say that I am not sure that all Czech cities do the same, but this holds true at least for Prague.

### 2.- Really good beer



### 3. Lots of graffities (not what you think)



### 4. A mix of cultures



### 5. Great public transportation service

others: a hauntingly interesting metro system, metro stairs that make you dizzy, strange/semi-erotical art and sense of humor
