# Five things you notice when you first arrive in Czech Republic

Czech Republic is probably one of the most underrated destinations in the world. It has beautiful landscapes, great job opportunities especially in the area of IT, a quite large expatiate community, amazing entertainment opportunities.

Here area few things you notice as soon as you arrive.

### 1.- Cobblestones everywhere

The first thing you notice is that all streets are made of cobblestones and it looks beautiful. I have to say that I am not 100% sure that all cities in Czechia do the same but this holds true for Prague.

Many times it happened to me that, while walking I would suddenly take a look back and see a beautiful scenery with castles and old buildings like taken out from a renaissance story. Many architectural gems from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era remain intact because the city was not destroyed during the First and Second World Wars.

### 2. A great public transportation service

Public transport is just flawless. It is extremely affordable and it works really well. A word of caution: As in most of public transport systems in the EU there is no system to check that you really purchased a metro or bus ticket. But don't try to trick the system! Many people try it, specially tourists. Penalties for not purchasing the ticket go up to 1000 Czech Korunas. While 1000 CZK (around 50 USD) is not a huge amount of money, it is a lot for the usual price of a ticket (around 1 USD). So, trust me and don't even try it no matter how easy it looks to do so.

Prague's subway metro system is interesting in a strange way. Most of the people will get dizzy when going downstairs first-time. This happens because the pictures on the walls are angled, creating a strange affect of leaning forwards (when going down) or backwards (when going up). Here is a quick GIF of them which show more or less the effect:

### 3.- Really good beer

I am not a *"connoisseur"* or beer but even with my limited beer-tasting skills I could easily know that Czech beer is among the best. For those who know more about beer they will enjoy the multiple choices and the fact that beer is actually cheaper than water.

### 4. Lots of graffities (not what you think)

It really surprised me to see lots of graffities in Prague. However these graffities have a different feeling. They are not the usual "fuck off" graffities that you would see in a bad neighborhood. They feel more like revolution graffities. Some of them are really impressive and even "intellectual" to some point.

The graffities belong to the *České vysoké učení technické* (CVUT) library.

### 5. A mix of cultures

Prague feels pretty much like New York City in the sense that it is a mix of many cultures converging into a single point at the same time. On any single day you will meet people from at least 30 different countries, no joke.
