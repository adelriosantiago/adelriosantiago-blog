# Five things you notice when you first arrive in Czech Republic

Czech Republic could be of the most underrated destinations in the world. It has beautiful landscapes, great job opportunities, amazing entertainment 

### 1.- Cobblestones everywhere

The first thing you notice is that all streets are made of cobblestones. It looks simply beautiful. I have to say that I am not 100% sure that all cities in Czechia do the same but this holds true for Prague.

### 2. A great public transportation service

Public transport is just flawless. It is extremely affordable and it works extremely well. A word of caution: As in most of public transport systems in the EU there is no system to check that you really purchased a metro or bus ticket but don't follow the advice of 

others: a hauntingly interesting metro system, metro stairs that make you dizzy, strange/semi-erotical art and sense of humor

### 3.- Really good beer



### 4. Lots of graffities (not what you think)



### 5. A mix of cultures
