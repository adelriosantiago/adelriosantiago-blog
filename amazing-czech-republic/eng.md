# Five things you notice when you first arrive in Czech Republic

Czech Republic could be of the most underrated destinations in the world. It has beautiful landscapes, great job opportunities, amazing entertainment 

### 1.- Cobblestones everywhere

The first thing you notice is that all streets are made of cobblestones. It looks simply beautiful. I have to say that I am not 100% sure that all cities in Czechia do the same but this holds true for Prague.

### 2. A great public transportation service

Public transport is just flawless. It is extremely affordable and it works extremely well. A word of caution: As in most of public transport systems in the EU there is no system to check that you really purchased a metro or bus ticket. Don't try to trick the system! Penalties for not purchasing the ticket go up to 1000 Czech Korunas. While 1000 CZK (around 50 USD) is not a huge amount of money, it is a lot for the usual price of a ticket (around 1 USD). So don't even try it.

### 3.- Really good beer

I am not a *connoisseur* or beer but even with my limited beer-tasting skills I could easily know that Czech beer is among the best.

### 4. Lots of graffities (not what you think)

It really surprised me to see lots of graffities in Prague. However these graffities have a different feeling. They are not the usual "fuck off" graffities that you would see in a bad neighborhood.

### 5. A mix of cultures

others: a hauntingly interesting metro system, metro stairs that make you dizzy, strange/semi-erotical art and sense of humor
