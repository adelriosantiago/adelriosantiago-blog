# Five things you notice when you first arrive in Czech Republic

Czech Republic is probably one of the most underrated destinations in the world. It has beautiful landscapes, great job opportunities especially in the area of engineering, a quite large expat community and amazing entertainment opportunities. In this article I write about the first five things you notice as soon as you arrive into Czech Republic.

### 1.- Cobblestones everywhere

The first thing you notice is that all streets are made of cobblestones and it looks beautiful. I have to say that I am not 100% sure that all cities in Czechia do the same but this holds true for Prague.

Many times it happened to me that, while walking I would suddenly take a look back and see a beautiful scenery with castles and old buildings like taken out from a renaissance storybook. Many architectural gems from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era remain intact because the city was not destroyed during the First and Second World Wars.

### 2. A great public transportation service

Public transport runs flawlessly here. Not only that, it is also very affordable and it runs during day and, with a few route exceptions, at night too. As in most of public transport systems in the EU there is no system to check that you really purchased a metro or bus ticket. A word of caution: Don't try to trick the system like many travelers do! I was amazed about the amount of tourists using the metro without paying. Penalties for not purchasing the ticket go up to 1000 Czech Korunas. While 1000 CZK (around 50 USD) is not a huge amount of money, it is a lot for the usual price of a ticket (around 1 USD). So, trust me, and don't even try it no matter how easy it is.

Prague's subway metro system is interesting in a strange way. Most of the people will get dizzy when going downstairs first-time. This happens because the pictures on the walls are angled, creating a strange affect of leaning forwards (when going down) or backwards (when going up). Here is a quick GIF of them which show more or less the effect:

### 3.- Really good beer

I am not a beer *"connoisseur"* but even with my limited beer-tasting skills I could easily know that Czech beer is among the best. For those who know more about beer they will enjoy the multiple choices and the fact that beer is actually cheaper than water. The culture towards beer is different from any other country. Here drinking beer during the evening is very normal. Be careful though: Drinking beer is normal here, *being drunk is not*. Being drunk is socially unacceptable across all Czechia. It is also very annoying for Czechs, some of whom believe foreigners just come to the city to get drunk and cause troubles.

### 4. Lots of graffities (although not the kind you think about)

It really surprised me to see lots of graffities in Prague. However these graffities have a different feeling. They are not the usual "fuck off" graffities that you would see in a bad neighborhood. Don't be scared about the amount of graffities you will see since [Czech Republic is the 8 safest country in the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/safest-countries-in-the-world). It is even safer than Switzerland. (Related: [Five things you notice when you first arrive in Switzerland](http://adelriosantiago.com/gitblog/eng/amazing-switzerland)). Gaffities in Czechia feel more like "revolution" graffities. Some of them are really impressive and even "intellectual" to some degree.

In my opinion the best graffities belong to the walls of the National Technical Library (*Národní technická knihovna* or just NTK for short).

Read a bit about the library itself and a little bit about the story behind these drawings in [this post about the National Technical Library](https://erasmusu.com/en/erasmus-prague/what-to-see/national-technical-library-2525).

### 5. A mix of cultures

Prague feels pretty much like New York City in the sense that it is a mix of many cultures converging into a single point at the same time. On any single day can easily meet people from at least 30 different countries. I may be wrong but I think there are even more diverse cultures in Prague than in New York City. This could be because of geographical reasons, being on the center of Europe you could find an airplane from London to Czechia in 20 dollars. This is not a typo, last minute flight seats inside Europe get as low as 8 dollars.

Czech Republic is a hidden gem, truly a place to never forget. I am looking forward to return back someday.
