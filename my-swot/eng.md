# My personal SWOT



in one of the assignatures by professor Daniel Holt (@DanielTHolt) 

SWOT, or Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats is a tool generally used by companies to asses themselves and their competitors. 

A SWOT helps potential creditors take important investing decisions. But this analysis can be applied to multiple entities, not only companies, but also individuals. In this article I publish my personal SWOT, an analysis of my own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. After all each of us is also a company itself.
