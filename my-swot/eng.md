# My personal SWOT

I started the Innovation MBA about one month ago at the University Of Louisville in Kentucky. The innovation [MBA is the ranked #25 in the U.S. by the Princeton Review](https://business.louisville.edu/academics-programs/graduate-programs/imba/#:~:text=Ranked%20%2325%20in%20the%20U.S.,only%2030%20students%20per%20cohort.), admission to the program is competitive, with only 30 students per cohort.

SWOT, or Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats is a tool generally used by companies to asses themselves and their competitors. 

A SWOT helps potential creditors take important investing decisions. But this analysis can be applied to multiple entities, not only companies, but also individuals. In this article I publish my personal SWOT, an analysis of my own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. After all each of us is also a company itself. 



We are the CEO of our own lives!
