# My personal SWOT

I started the Innovation MBA about one month ago at the University Of Louisville in Kentucky. The innovation [MBA is the ranked #25 in the U.S. by the Princeton Review](https://business.louisville.edu/academics-programs/graduate-programs/imba/#:~:text=Ranked%20%2325%20in%20the%20U.S.,only%2030%20students%20per%20cohort.), admission to the program is competitive, with only 30 students per cohort.

SWOT, or Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats is a tool generally used by companies to asses themselves and their competitors.

A SWOT helps potential creditors take important investing decisions. But this analysis can be applied to multiple entities, not only companies, but also individuals. In this article I publish my personal SWOT, an analysis of my own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. After all each of us is also a company itself.

We are the CEO of our own lives!

Description of each item:

- _1_: I've always said that _"discipline is my second name"_. Whenever I start something I _usually_ finish it. This is the case of [my Duolingo streak](http://adelriosantiago.com/gitblog/spa/100-duolingo) which started as a 10 day streak that I couldn't stop. As I write this my duolingo streak is of 2320 days. I truly believe that habits are the single most important tool every person has.
- _1_: This is a degree that may be useful to advance my carrer in the area of IT.
- _11_: I have been investing a lot of time an effort in learning AI and ML. Most recently by getting ML certified by HarvardX. It seems that the actual benefits of AI and ML have been finally taking-off in recent years.
- _234_: I am fully vaccinated (twice Pfizer shot) but recent mutations have shown COVID to be a threat even to those already vaccinated.
