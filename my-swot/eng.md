# My personal SWOT

I started an MBA about one month ago at the University Of Louisville in Kentucky. The [Innovation MBA](https://business.louisville.edu/academics-programs/graduate-programs/imba/#:~:text=Ranked%20%2325%20in%20the%20U.S.,only%2030%20students%20per%20cohort.) is ranked #25 by the Princeton Review, admission to the program is competitive, with only 30 students per cohort.

During Strategic Analysis by Prof. PhD. Daniel T. Holt ([@DanielTHolt](https://twitter.com/danieltholt)) we reviewed the SWOT framework. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats is a tool generally used by companies to asses themselves and their competitors.

This analysis can be applied to multiple entities, not only companies, but also individuals. In this article I publish my personal SWOT, an analysis of my own Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. After all, each of us is a company itself.

### Description of each item

- _1_: I've always said that _"discipline is my second name"_. Whenever I start something I _usually_ finish it. This is the case of [my Duolingo streak](http://adelriosantiago.com/gitblog/spa/100-duolingo) which started as a 100 day streak that I couldn't stop. As I write this my Duolingo streak is of 2320 days. I believe habits are the single most important tool every person has to build his/her future.
- _2_: This degree has helped me land job opportunities in many countries. I graduated with a score of 90/100, equivalent to 3.7 GPA. This is score, while not particularly impressing, was big achievement for me.
- _3_: I am an entrepreneur by heart. I love being challenged to stay out of my comfort zone. I must say that I have my limits though. I hate time-constrained environments. I would rather write an entire book about a subject I know nothing about for one year than to answer a difficult one hour math exam.
- _4_: I believe this MBA will be a game-changer for my career. I see a lot of opportunities to make my ideas come true.
- _5_: I have been investing a lot of time and effort in learning AI and ML. This poses a good opportunity for everyone in specialized in this area given that [the world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/11/15/data-is-the-new-oil-and-thats-a-good-thing/).
- _6_: I am not afraid to mention it: I am quite unpunctual. And I need to work on this. [I wrote about this before](http://adelriosantiago.com/gitblog/eng/amazing-switzerland). While working in Switzerland I would miss almost every single train. I never realized how different I perceived time until until I worked in CH.
- _7_: ...
- _8_: I am fully vaccinated (twice with a Pfizer shot). Nevertheless recent mutations have shown COVID to be a threat even to those already vaccinated. Nobody is expempt to randomly dying of COVID. _Unsettling sidenote: [WHO runs out of COVID names, announces new naming system.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57308592)_

I hope to find a way to circumvent my weaknesses. However my plan is capitalize my strengths.
