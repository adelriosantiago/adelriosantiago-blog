# Wikipedia, wordclouds and MongoDB to diagnose diseases

This is a very simple simple application that uses a [Word Frequency Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_lists_by_frequency) to give the user a glance of what kind of disease might he/she have by using a wordcloud.

The idea is present an easy-to-read list of possible diseases. Wordcloud engine credits belong to: https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud.

Go ahead to [the demo](http://wordcloud.adelriosantiago.com) and try writing some symptoms like: "I have a high pulse rate and high temperature" to see some results.
