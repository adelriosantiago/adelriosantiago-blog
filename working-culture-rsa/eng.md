# How to create the right workplace culture at your organization or startup

Creating a great workplace culture is essential for any organization or startup. If you run any kind of organization, big or small startup, then this video by **Mr. Dave Coplin** ([@dcoplin](https://twitter.com/dcoplin)) and the RSA is a must see to understand why it is important to give employees more freedom to choose how they want to work.

There are a lot of organizations with similar values and similar missions. All of them hire more or less the same kind of people, with similar skills and similar mindsets. They all create products that are *-in most of the cases-* similar to other existing products. These organizations also work more or less with the same tools than others. Interestingly, their ultimate purpose is also the same: **They all want to be different.**

Here are a few points that I personally recommend to any startup founder wanting to grow their organizations with the best talent available:

1.- **Be flexible:** Allow people to choose how they want to work. Google is probably the best example of flexibility at work. It might surprise you to know that there are [slides inside Google](https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-office-slides-2012-5). One of the hidden purposes of such unconventional prop is to communicate their openness and flexibility to *do things differently*.

2.- **Be innovative:** Many big companies are not afraid to change the rules of the game. Why wouldn't you dare to do the same in your startup then? There are more efficient communication tools like Telegram, HipChat and more recently, Microsoft Teams. These tools may help organization mitigate issues that may happen when using email. Mails allow sending private information, *intentionally or unintentionally*, to any person outside the organization, possibly causing intellectual property damages.

3.- **Repeat and repeat again the new culture ideals:** Making a culture change inside an organization is hard. It is essentially changing how people think. The problem is that, it is part of our human nature to be afraid of change. We fear change because changes may bring mistakes. And be fear mistakes because mistakes are heavily penalized in old work cultures. New workplace cultures focus more on *preventing mistakes* rather than castigating them.
